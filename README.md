# TightfaultProject
Moving Tightfault to the latest version

# What do i write
Alright so I made Tightfault for 1.18

I don't really feel like working on a 1.17 or 1.16 version of the pack (unless i get lots of requests to do so)

# Connected Textures
I will be working on CTM support and MCPatcher support for this pack, but MCPatcher is currently priority as it's the most popular Connected Textures format
